            "description": "I Engineered and deployed Python based web applications using Django, Redis for caching, and Celery for task queue management. I enhanced database efficiency by optimizing schemas, which sped up data storage and retrieval while reducing server load. I also played a key role in accelerating microservices development and deployment by leveraging gRPC, SQLAlchemy, FastAPI, and Docker, resulting in a 30% faster time-to-market for new features. Additionally, I explored methods to visualize and send daily reports of test results to team members, improving communication and decision making processes."
